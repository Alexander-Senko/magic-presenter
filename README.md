## Installation

TODO: Replace `UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG` with your gem name right after releasing it to RubyGems.org. Please do not do it earlier due to security reasons. Alternatively, replace this section with instructions to install your gem from git if you don't plan to release to RubyGems.org.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

## Usage

`Magic::Presenter::Base` is a basic presenter class to be inherited by any other presenter.
It further inherits from [`SimpleDelegator`](
	https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/SimpleDelegator.html
).

```ruby
class PersonPresenter < Magic::Presenter::Base
  def name = "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
end

class Person
  include ActiveModel::Model
  attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name
end

person = Person.new(first_name: 'John', last_name: 'Smith').decorate
person.name # => "John Smith"
```

### `Magic::Presentable`

This module includes `Magic::Decoratable` and allows a descendant to be decorated by presenters only.
Presenter class is being inferred automatically.
When no presenter is found,
- `#decorate`  returns `nil`,
- `#decorate!` raises `Magic::Lookup::Error`,
- `#decorated` returns the original object.

## Magic

Itâ€™s based on [Magic Decorator](
	https://github.com/Alexander-Senko/magic-decorator#magic
), so get familiar with that one as well.

### Presentable scope

`Magic::Presentable` is mixed into `ActiveModel::Model` by default.
It means that any model, be it `ActiveRecord::Base`, `Mongoid::Document` or whatever else, is _magically presentable_.

### Presenter class inference

Presenters provide automatic class inference for any model based on its class name powered by [Magic Lookup](
	https://github.com/Alexander-Senko/magic-lookup
).

For example, `MyNamespace::MyModel.new.decorate` looks for `MyNamespace::MyModelPresenter` first.
When missing, it further looks for decorators for its ancestor classes, up to `ObjectPresenter`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

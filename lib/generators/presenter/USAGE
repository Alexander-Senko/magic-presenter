Description:
    Generates a new presenter for a model. Pass the model name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, as an argument.

    This generator invokes your configured test framework, which
    defaults to TestUnit. It supports both TestUnit and RSpec.

    If a `--parent` option is given, itâ€™s used as a superclass of the
    created presenter.

Example:
    bin/rails generate presenter account

    This will create:
        Presenter:  app/presenters/account_presenter.rb
      for TestUnit:
        Test:       test/presenters/account_presenter_test.rb
      for RSpec:
        Spec:       spec/presenters/account_presenter_spec.rb

    bin/rails generate presenter admin/account

    This will create:
        Presenter:  app/presenters/admin/account_presenter.rb
      for TestUnit:
        Test:       test/presenters/admin/account_presenter_test.rb
      for RSpec:
        Spec:       spec/presenters/admin/account_presenter_spec.rb
